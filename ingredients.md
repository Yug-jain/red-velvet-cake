All-purpose flour or cake flour? Although cake flour is usually used for classic red velvet recipes to make it light, I wanted to stick to all-purpose flour in my recipe, so that everyone can make it. I use a combination of all purpose flour and cornstarch, so the cake turns out tender and delicious. If you prefer using cake flour use 3 cups of it.

Red food coloring: what makes red velvet cake red is the food coloring. If you donâ€™t use it, the cake will have a dark reddish-brown color.

Cocoa powder: I use 2 tablespoons in my recipe, which is just right to get the color and flavor that I look for. Some recipes use 3 tablespoons or more for a bit more chocolatey flavor, but in this case, I like to stick to the classic. Both Dutch-process or natural cocoa powder work here.

Oil or Butter? The first cakes I tried were only with butter, because, well, I love butter. But once I started using oil (after I saw that Southern recipes use only oil, and I got curious), I realized my cake was less dry. To enjoy both worlds I use some butter for flavor, and oil for the fluffiest texture and extra moist cake.

Vinegar: I use apple cider vinegar, but any white vinegar would work, like the ones you use for a salad dressing
